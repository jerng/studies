    Here, <code>script[type=module]</code> allows usage of the
    <code>import</code> imperative to link in the <code>jsf.js</code> module
    located at 'URL'. (The module's code is executed.) After which, Actor is in
    scope, and IAmANewActor is instantiated. However, in another
    <code>script</code> below, Actor is no longer in scope, and IAmAnotherActor
    cannot be instantiated.

    <script>

        console.log ('index.html body')

        //  The following imperative will fail, because Actor is not in scope in
        //      this script tag. 
        setTimeout ( () => console.log( new Actor('IAmAnotherActor') ), 2000 )
