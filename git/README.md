# This is simply a FHD-formatted copy of [ the Glossary from the Git website ]( https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary/2.30.0 ) as of August 2023.

## I also compiled [ A Systematic Introduction to Git ](https://sextechandmergers.blogspot.com/2023/08/a-systematic-introduction-to-git.html), but it is quite raw, and therefore less readily presented.
