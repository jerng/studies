    Here, <code>script[type=module][src=URL]</code> links in the
    <code>exampleProxyModule.js</code> module located at 'URL'. (The module's
    code is executed, where it imports <code>jsf.js</code> bringing Actor into
    its scope, and IAmANewActor is instantiated.  However, in another
    <code>script</code> below, Actor is no longer in scope, and IAmAnotherActor
    cannot be instantiated.) 

    <script>

        console.log ('index.html body')

        //  The following imperative will fail, because Actor is not in scope in
        //      this script tag. 
        setTimeout ( () => console.log( new Actor('IAmAnotherActor') ), 2000 )
