    <h1>a simple view: </h1> 
    Following this is an attempt to interpolate some Haskell expressions<br/>
    Haskell script "1 +1" : <hs>(1+1)</hs><br/>
    a ViewableList key called (someInt) : <hs>viewInt "someInt"</hs><br/>
    a ViewableList key called (someFloat) : <hs>viewFloat "someFloat"</hs><br/>
    a Viewable called (someText) : <hs>viewText "someText"</hs><br/>
    a Viewable called (someIntList) : <hs>viewIntList "someIntList"</hs><br/>
    <br/>
    These are defined in (Hell.Conf.viewableListHelpers). For now, you'll have to
    write a new helper function, every time you want to pass another type into
    the view. The current mechanism uses the Dynamic type to pass data 
    through the ViewableList, and I am wondering if using (read)-(show) would be
    performant (it would certainly provide less to code against).
