    <h1>a simple view: </h1> 
    Following this is an attempt to interpolate some Haskell expressions<br/>
    1 +1 : <hs>(1+1)</hs><br/>
    a variable called (someVar) : <hs>someVar</hs><br/>
    <br/>
    The objective here is to run all of this inside a (do{}) statement, within
    a (Controller.action), so that the scope is confined to that.<br/>
    <br/>
    I had earlier thought of using the architecture where the (Controller.action)
    returns parameters and control to (Server.main) to have rendering done
    elsewhere, at a higher level, but the passing of variables seems to involve
    much boilerplate. I'm still thinking about this. And about how much time 
    this is consuming to no definite end, subtracting from  my general scheme of 
    studies.
