What it says.

# Quick Start

0.  Start by reading `type_system.hs`.
0.  Have a look at `idioms.hs`
0.  `operator_experiments.hs` may provide some fun.
0.  `list_comprehensions_desugared.hs` shoes just that, of course.

# Text

0.  Some common types are demonstrated in: `text_types.hs`
0.  `hello_world/` contains examples, of course.
0.  `regex.hs` has working examples of some relevant libraries.

# MongoDB

0.  `mongo/` contains examples, of course.
0.  `serialisebson.hs` shows an example of how to do this.

# Miscellany

0.  Take a look at the Dynamic type in `dynamic.hs`
0.  `run_executable_with_working_directory.hs` provides one such example.
0.  `transform_list_comp.hs` demonstrates an extension that allows SQL-esque
    keywords like 'group', 'by' and 'using' to be applied to list
    comprehensions.
0.  `th.hs` and `Thlib.hs` show a bit about how Template Haskell works.
