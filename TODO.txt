Deal with missing keys in ViewableList (currently: crashes without much description).

Implement a helper function for populating the ViewableList in Controllers.

   :Test if it is performant to pass variables using
  (show) and (read) instead of Dynamic. Doing so might reduce
  boilerplate and the need for utility functions. But I am
  concerned that it will run slowly.

Implement redirection, from one action, to another action.

Implement a simple form helper.

Implement a URL helper.

Replace usage of Text with usage of Builders (since all Text is ultimately converted to Builder).

Check functionality of Warp sessions. Check functionality of Warp cookies.
Following these, implement authentication.

Check functional limits:
Can all View code share scope? (e.g. all run within a do {})

Chore-like:
In Hell.Conf, (controllers), (views), etc. should return a list of type (HellResource { name :: x ,  type ::, fromPath ::, toPath ::} ; of course, first define this in Hell.Types
